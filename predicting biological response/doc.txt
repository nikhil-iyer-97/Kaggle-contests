The ipython notebooks contain the kernels needed to score less than 0.6 in the competition.
The 'Classification.ipynb' contains code which uses logistic regression to classify if the
molecule elicited a response. The 'classification_with_PCA.ipynb' notebook has code in which PCA
has been implemented. The number of features that gave best output for Logistic Regression
was found to be 1100. The results improved marginally.

The conclusion henceforth is that PCA does not contribute to the improvement of the classifying
model. Other approaches have to be utilized to get a better score.
